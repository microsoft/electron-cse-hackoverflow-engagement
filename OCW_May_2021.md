## Expectations

Going into One CSE Week, we prioritized a list of existing Electron fiddle examples to update to the latest version of Electron (v12). One of the main changes was switching to the secure-by-default isolation context for separate processes.

The prioritized list:

- docs/fiddles/features/drag-and-drop - #9
- docs/fiddles/features/keyboard-shortcuts/global - #24
- docs/fiddles/features/keyboard-shortcuts/interception-from-main - #12
- docs/fiddles/features/keyboard-shortcuts/local - #27
- docs/fiddles/features/macos-dark-mode - #51
- docs/fiddles/features/macos-dock-menu - #28
- docs/fiddles/features/notifications/main - #18
- docs/fiddles/features/notifications/renderer - #10
- docs/fiddles/features/offscreen-rendering - #50
- docs/fiddles/features/online-detection/main - #54
- docs/fiddles/features/online-detection/renderer - #15
- docs/fiddles/features/progress-bar - #16
- docs/fiddles/features/recent-documents - #68
- docs/fiddles/features/represented-file - #19

We expected active participants to contribute at least one example update over the course of the week regardless of their familiarity with Electorn. For participants already familiar with Electron, we expected at least two contributions.

## Results

Due to the nature of One CSE Week, not all of the registered participants were able to actively participate throughout the week. For those that were able to actively participate, they exceeded expectations!

All of the planned task items were worked on, many completing by the end of the week. A couple items only require a little more work to complete (and are being closed out by Ethan Arrowood).

See the [One CSE Week project board](https://github.com/microsoft/electron-cse-hackoverflow-engagement/projects/3) for more details.

Additionally, one of the participants was able to contribute to the new Electron documentation site as well:

- https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org-new/pull/35
- https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org-new/pull/36

The demo call where participants presented the work they accomplished and the things they learned was recorded and folks can watch it [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/e8a60840-98dc-869c-c5d7-f1ebba6b719f). Reach out to Ethan Arrowood (etarrowo internally) with any issues.

## Feedback

After the event, feedback discussions were held with both participants and organizers. The following section is directly based on their responses.

## Takeaways

The week was full of impactful contributions from all of those involved. We collaborated directly with other Electron maintainers and contributors, and became apart of the larger Electron community.
